The goal of this project is to provide an open-source material to build and operate a setup featuring
omniwheel robots and a soccer field monitoring them with a camera.

With this setup, it is possible for two teams to code a program and play against each other.

<div class="text-warning">
    This is a WORK IN PROGRESS, you can't (yet) build the whole setup by following instructions from
    this documentation, if any question, do not hesitate to open an issue
