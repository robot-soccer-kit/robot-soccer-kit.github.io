# Wheels assembly

## Step 1: fixing the coupler

First, fix the coupler to the first part of the wheel like this using 4x M3x8 screws and nuts:

</center>

## Step 2: passive wheels

Then, place the passive wheels (with bearings and shafts) on the wheel. This is the most tedious part. You
can use the coupler as a stand:

</center>

## Step 3: close the wheel

Now, fix the other part of the wheel to the first part using the 6x M3x8 screws and nuts.
