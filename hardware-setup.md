Here is everything you will need to assemble the setup:

<table class="table table-striped table-responsive">
    <tr>
        <th>
        Part
        </th>
        <th style="min-width:25%">
        Reference
        </th>
        <th>
        Comment
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="/assets/imgs/field.png" width="128" /><br/>
        </td>
        <td>
            Field
        </td>
        <td>
            <span class="text-danger">It must be made of a thick carpet, so that the ball is stopped enough.
            Else, the game experience will be very poor.</span>
            <br/>
            You can buy a thick green carpet of 2x2.5m, paint it, and print and stick
            <a href="/coordinates-field-markers">field markers</a>.

            120Â° angle
            </code>
        </td>
        <td>
            You can source other cameras, but the opening angle should be wide enough to see the whole field
        </td>
    </tr>

            PU Orange ball
        </td>
        <td>
            Those are golf-size balls made of some foam material called PU. It weights around 8g.
        </td>
    </tr>

            ZEXMTE Bluetooth adapter
        </td>
        <td>
            You can give a try to your computer integrated Bluetooth, but there are chances that the quality
            of communication will not be good enough. This dongle was tested to work well with the kit.

            3m USB extension
        </td>
        <td>
            The camera will be attached to the field structure, so you need an extension cable to connect it
            to your computer. 3m is a good length.

            PVC tubes
        </td>
        <td>
            For the field structure, you can use PVC tubes, we recommend (all 50mm diameter):
            <ul>
                <li>2x 50cm tube</li>
                <li>6x 100cm tube</li>
                <li>5x L-shape connector</li>
                <li>3x T-shape connector</li>
                <li>2x female-female extension connector</li>
            </ul>
