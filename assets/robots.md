    * 18x M3x8 screws
    * 18x M3 nuts
    * 9x M3x8 screws
    * 9x M3 square nuts

## PCB

Robot PCB can be found in the [/electronics/](/electronics/) directory of this repository.

## Motors

![GA12-N20](/docs/imgs/n20.png)

* Reference: GA12-N20
* Hall encoder
* Reduction ratio 1:210, metal gears
* Connector: 6-pin JST-ZH

The current reduction trade-off offers a high torque and the speed of the robots are thus limited.
This is however not an issue in adversarial game where precision counts more than velocity.

## Bluetooth communication

![HC-05](/docs/imgs/hc-05.png)

HC-05 modules are soldered on the robot PCB and allowing Bluetooth to on-board UART communication.

## Kicker

![Kicker](/docs/imgs/kicker.png)

### PCB

Kicker PCB can be found in the [/electronics/kicker](/electronics/kicker) directory of this repository.

It features MT3608 step-up converter to load a bank of capacitors that can then be unloaded in the
solenoid.

### Solenoid

![Solenoid](/docs/imgs/solenoid.png)

* 6V JF-0530B

### Operating

![Kicker](/docs/imgs/kicker_pcb.png)

The kicker is stepping up input voltage to approximate 20V to charge a bank of capacitors (9x 470uF rated
for 25V).

Thanks to a MOSFET transistor, the capacitors can be discharged directly in the solenoid, triggering the kicker.

The duration of the pulse in the MOSFET allows to control the power of the kick.
